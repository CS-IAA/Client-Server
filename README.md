# Network-Application

Developed a network application in Java using multithreads. The application consists of a centralized Math server and two or more clients. The client(s) send basic math calculation requests to the server and the server answers in the order of the request. The server can have multiple simultaneous clients and keeps activity logs of each client.

To start the program on console, run make -f Makefile.sh. Afterwards, compile the .java files and then write java Server to start the server and java Client to set up a client.
